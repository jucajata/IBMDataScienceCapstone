'''Build a Dashboard Application with Plotly Dash

In this lab, you will be building a Plotly Dash application for users to 
perform interactive visual analytics on SpaceX launch data in real-time.

This dashboard application contains input components such as a dropdown 
list and a range slider to interact with a pie chart and a scatter point 
chart. You will be guided to build this dashboard application via the 
following tasks:

    TASK 1: Add a Launch Site Drop-down Input Component
    TASK 2: Add a callback function to render success-pie-chart based on selected site dropdown
    TASK 3: Add a Range Slider to Select Payload
    TASK 4: Add a callback function to render the success-payload-scatter-chart scatter plot
